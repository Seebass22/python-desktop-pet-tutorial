title:  "Turning the python script into an executable"
---

There are a [few ways](https://docs.python-guide.org/shipping/freezing/) to create a windows executable from python code. I'll be discussing two of them - pyinstaller and cx_Freeze.
You can use either of these. This page will give a short summary of how to use them. Refer to their documentation for for more detailed help if you need it.

# option 1: pyinstaller
install pyinstaller with pip:
```
pip install pyinstaller
```

The simplest way of creating an executable with pyinstaller looks like this
```
pyinstaller yourprogram.py
```

This creates a bunch of files and two directories: `build` and `dist`. Your executable will land in `dist`.

..but if you try this, you'll notice that it does not bundle any extra files that your program requires (such as your animations).
To do this, you'll need to copy the files to the destination directory. You can use the `--add-data` flag to achieve this or just copy the files yourself. The `-y` flag overwrites the existing directory without prompting.

```
pyinstaller -y --add-data '*.gif;.' yourprogram.py
```
`--add-data '*.gif;.'` means copy all `.gif` files to the root of the executable folder.

or (for all animations)
```
cp youranimation.gif dist\yourprogram\
```

# option 2: cx_Freeze
install cx_Freeze with pip:
```
pip install cx_Freeze
```

# Things to be aware of
- can cause antivirus false positives
